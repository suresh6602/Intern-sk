  <p>Kalam took great care of his colleagues. A co-worker had promised his kids that he
    would take them to the science museum after returning from work, and obtained the
    prior permission of Mr. Kalam to leave early. The colleague was so engrossed in his
    work that it was well into the evening when he realised that he had made a promise to
    his kids. On rushing back home, he came to know from his wife that Mr. Kalam had
    come earlier and taken his kids to the museum.
